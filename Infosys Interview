1 technical round: clear your core java concepts very well and have confidence on yourself then absolutely no one can stop you to clear 
infosys interview :)

1. List<Object> list = new ArrayList<String>();
will this above code compile?
2. write a program to reverse a string without using stringbuilder or stringbuffer
s= "welcome to infosys";
output: infosys to welcome
here we can use StringTokenizer
3. why String is immutable
4. Convert Array to ArrayList
5. Diff. b/w Exception and error
6. Can you catch(means handle) all exceptions? (Not all like nullPointerException )
8. String s2 = new String("abc"); does this string s is stored in string pool ?   
   string is created using new operator, it will force JVM to create new string in heap (not in string pool).
   
9. how to make string s which is made newly by using new keyword to go to string pool?
   Answer: user intern() function which will intern the string and fetch it from string pool 
String s5 = new String("abc").intern();
string is created using new operator but intern method has been invoked on it, so s5 will be a reference variable which will refer 
to “abc” in string pool.
