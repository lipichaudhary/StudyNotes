#Creating basic spring mvc project using maven

New-> MavenProject -> next -> it will show bunch of archetypes already created for me inside of Maven, inside of the Maven Repository.

An ARCHETYPE is just a DIRECTORY STRUTURE that follows the format i want to use and does some default things for me.

Artifact ID is my application name.
