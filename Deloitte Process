8th FEB 2017:

Ok so yesterday i got call from HR for 1 last time. She told me that i have successfully cleared all the rounds and we want to offer you . After that she asked me few questions like notice period , total exerience, expected ctc, why that much , location .

And day after that i got salary breakup mail from HR. They offered me more than what i have asked . The office formal letter they will send by next week.

So this is the complete story of me and deloitte . Hope this will help someone in future as i was also looking for detailed information about interview process.

The most important thing for deloitte is ur confident . If you answer them 70% with confidence and ur communication if above avg you can clear all these round.
Best of luck .!!!
