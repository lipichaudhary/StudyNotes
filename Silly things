today i got to know my silly mistake or i can say lack of practice :p
Print the elements of array  in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.
Sample Input
4
1 4 3 2
Sample Output
2 3 4 1

usually we will use System.out.println(); to print the elements , nut in this case we have to use System.out.print();
then only it will print in same line coz println means to print it in next line. 

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = in.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for(int i=0; i < n; i++){
            arr[i] = in.nextInt();
        }
        in.close();
        for(int j=arr.length-1;j>=0;j--){
            System.out.print(arr[j]+" ");   // REMEMBER WE HAVE USED print(); instead of println(); in order to print it in same line
        }
        
    }
}
