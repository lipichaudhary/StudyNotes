today i got to know my silly mistake or i can say lack of practice :p
Print the elements of array  in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.
Sample Input
4
1 4 3 2
Sample Output
2 3 4 1

usually we will use System.out.println(); to print the elements , nut in this case we have to use System.out.print();
then only it will print in same line coz println means to print it in next line. 

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = in.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for(int i=0; i < n; i++){
            arr[i] = in.nextInt();
        }
        in.close();
        for(int j=arr.length-1;j>=0;j--){
            System.out.print(arr[j]+" ");   // REMEMBER WE HAVE USED print(); instead of println(); in order to print it in same line
        }
        
    }
}

String.intern() : string interning is a method of storing only one copy of each distinct string value, which must be immutable.
It can be used to return the string from pool memory, if it is created by new keyword

String s1=new String("hello");  
String s2="hello";  
String s3=s1.intern();//returns string from pool, now it will be same as s2  
System.out.println(s1==s2);//false because reference is different  
System.out.println(s2==s3);//true because reference is same
