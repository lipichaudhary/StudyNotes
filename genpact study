In OS deadlock occurs when a process or thread enters a waiting state bcz the system resource which was requested  is held by another
waiting process which in turn is waiting for the another resource held by the another waiting process.

if a process is unable to change its its state indefinitely bcz the resources requested by it are being used by another waiting process
then the system is said to be in deadlock state.
