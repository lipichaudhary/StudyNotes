Association can be one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many.
In above example two separate classes Bank and Employee are associated through their Objects. Bank can have many employees,
So it is a one-to-many relationship.

Aggregation

It is a special form of Association where:
It represents Has-A relationship.
It is a unidirectional association i.e. a one way relationship. For example, department can have students but vice versa is not possible 
and thus unidirectional in nature.
In Aggregation, both the entries can survive individually which means ending one entity will not effect the other entity

When do we use Aggregation ??
Code reuse is best achieved by aggregation.

Composition

Composition is a restricted form of Aggregation in which two entities are highly dependent on each other.

It represents part-of relationship.
In composition, both the entities are dependent on each other.
When there is a composition between two entities, the composed object cannot exist without the other entity.

In above example a library can have no. of books on same or different subjects. So, If Library gets destroyed then 
All books within that particular library will be destroyed. i.e. book can not exist without library. That’s why it is composition.

Aggregation vs Composition

Dependency: Aggregation implies a relationship where the child can exist independently of the parent. 
For example, Bank and Employee, delete the Bank and the Employee still exist. whereas Composition implies a relationship where 
the child cannot exist independent of the parent. Example: Human and heart, heart don’t exist separate to a Human
Type of Relationship: Aggregation relation is “has-a” and composition is “part-of” relation.
Type of association: Composition is a strong Association whereas Aggregation is a weak Association.
