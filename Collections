Java Maps
Map is an interface that provides a blueprint for data structures that take  pairs and map keys to their associated values 
(it's important to note that both the  and the  must be Objects and not primitives). 
The implementation is done by implementing classes such as HashMap or LinkedHashMap. 

HashMap : it have key/value pairs
No duplicate keys are allowed.
if any duplicate key is inserted then its old value is replaced by new value.
there can be duplicate values but no duplicate key
Only one null key is allowed but there can be multiple null values.

HashSet: 1. means no duplicate elements.If you try to add a duplicate element in hashset then the old value would be overridden.
2. Internal functioning of hashset uses hasMap but hashset have only elements which can be either key or value.
It doesn't have key value both.
3.it allows only one null element(key or value).
4.No order is maintained.
5.Implements SET interface. 
6. It is non-synchronized.
7. To make hashset as synchronized :     Set s=Collections.synchronizedSet(new hashSet());
8.Backed by hashtable (actually a hashMap instance)
9.It returns fail fast iterator. It will throw ConcurrentModificationException if hashSet is modified after creation of iterator,
except the iterator's own remove();

question: 3 ways to prevent concurrentModificationException to occur?
