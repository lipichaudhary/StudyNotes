1st Round: F2F
Comparable vs Comparator in Java: Both are Interfaces which are used to sort the collection elements.
Comparable:                                                                    Comparator
1. Provides Single Sorting Sequence. In other words we can sort     1. Provides Multiple sorting sequence. Means we can sort the collection
the collections on basis of single element i.e. id ,name or price     on the basis of multiple elememnts i.e. id,nameor price
2. Affects the original class i.e. actual class is modified         2. Doesn't affect the original class i.e. actual class is not modified.
3. It provides CompareTo()to sort the elements                      3. It provides Compare() to sort the elements
4. It is found in java.lang package                                 4. Found in java.util package
5. we can sort the list elements of comparable type by              5. We can sort the list elements of comparator type by
Collections.sort(list);                                                Collections.sort(list,comparator);
