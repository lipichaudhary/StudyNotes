Telephonic Interview:
1. Difference b/w Path and ClassPath?
Path: Once you installed java in your machine, It is required to set the PATH environment variable to conveniently run the executables
(javac.exe, javadoc.exe,java.exe and so on) from any directory without having to type the full path of the command. For e.g.
C:\javac TestClass.java
otherwise u need to specify the whole path everytime you run it:
C:\Java\jdk1.7.0\bin\javac TestClass.java

ClassPath:Classpath is system environment variable which is used by java compiler and JVM to determine the exact location of required class file.
C:\ProgramFiles\java\jdk1.6.0\bin

Path variable is used to set the path for all java software tools like javac.exe,
