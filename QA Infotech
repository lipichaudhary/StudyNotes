1st Round: Telephonic round

1. internal working of hashmap
2. Concurrent HashMap 
3. if there are 3 threads that r working on HashMap : T1 and T2 are accessing the hashmap and T3 calls map.clear() on it 
then what will happen? whether T1 and T2 will return sme value or sme error by T3?
my Ans: T3 will clear the map so t1 and t2 will return an empty map.
4.Diff. between ArrayList and LinkedList? 
why searching is faster in arraylist whereas inserting and deleting from arraylist is more expensive , briefly explain
