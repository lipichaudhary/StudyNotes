Immutable Class:
Class whose object cannot be modified once created.If any modification is done then it will result in new object.
Modification to an immutable object results in new object.for example, String in java is immutable. 
Mostly, immutable are final in java in order to prevent sub class from overriding methods in Java which can compromise Immutability.
Another way of achieving immutablity without making them final is by making them private, and also not modifying them except in constructor.
