Difference between 


what is classloader? It loads the JAVA class file into JVM.
class Loader is a part of JVM and it does nothing but loading the class for JVM from the library where the demanded class is present.
JVM doesn't need to know the name of the class needed and the dependent classes on it.
There are many types of class loaders , the 3 important ones are: Bootstrap, extension and System class loader
1. Bootstrap loader: this is at the topmost position in hierarchy of class loaders.
It loads the core java classes like java.util, java.lang etc.These are the classes are part of the java runtime environment.
Bootstrap classloader is the native implementation and so they may differ across different JVMs.

2. Extension : JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext contains the jar packages which are the extensions of the standard core java classes.Extension classloader
loads the classes from ext folder.Using the system environment property java.ext.dirs you can add 'ext' folders and jars files to be loaded 
using extensions class loader.

3. System class loader: Java classes that are available in the classpath are loaded using system class loader.

Java ClassLoader are hierarchical and whenever a request is raised to load a class, it delegates it to its parent and in this way 
uniqueness is maintained in the runtime environment. 
If the parent class loader doesnâ€™t find the class then the class loader itself tries to load the class.

Class loader can load classes from one level above its hierarchy. First level is bootstrap class loader, 
second level is extensions class loader and third level is system class loader.
