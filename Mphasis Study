Round 1 - What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?  
Answer Question
Array 
Array is a fixed size data structure while ArrayList is not. 
One need not to mention the size of Arraylist while creating its object. Even if we specify some initial capacity, 
we can add more elements.
Array can contain both primitive data types as well as objects of a class depending on the definition of the array. However, ArrayList only supports object entries, not the primitive data types.
Note: When we do arraylist.add(1); : it converts the primitive int data type into an Integer object.
