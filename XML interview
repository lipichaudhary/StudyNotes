XML Namespaces: Are used to avoid element name conflicts while merging 2 xml documents.
Element names are defined by the developer. This often results in a conflict when trying to mix XML documents from different XML applications.

When using prefixes in XML, a namespace for the prefix must be defined.
The namespace can be defined by an xmlns attribute in the start tag of an element.
The namespace declaration has the following syntax. xmlns:prefix="URI".
